Goal -> To create a database which allows anyone to upload anything that can be sold by anyone.


Uses:
Jane informs us that Bob is selling a chair for 20$ tomorrow only.
Joe informs us that Bob sold him the chair it went well.
Knotis rewards Jane with a discount at Joe's.
Jane send's Bob a message, Bob has employee who replies.
Joe uploads information about a new business.

Concerns:
Content is generated by users, we need to have a reputation for each user. Are reputations specific based on case? Or are they generalized? A users reputation for given things is non-uniform. Certain users will be more authoritative on certain things. This has the potential to be confusing if it's not easy to use.

What is the relationship between products? and purchasable items?

A product is a conceptual idea that two things are the same in all ways except price, location & vendor? Or is it the notion that two products have something in common?


Products have tags:
   I am selling a hamburgerer at Bob's for 10$ from 10am-9pm s-t and 10-2am f and sat. It's 1/2 lbs and rated 4/5 stars.

   Some similarities are ranges, lbs, costs, hours, locations, others are discrete "vegetarian options".



How do we generalize the problem of shit people upload into a beautiful datastructure?
