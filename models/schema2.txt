Major Sections

1) Sessions

2) Permissions, Roles, Users
  i) we should have this automatically with django - just need to create the various roles.
  ii) how are we handling aging of personal information? passwords, emails, addresses, etc.?

3) Content, uploads, (text, values, ranges), hours, reviews, likes, comments, forum posts, anything.
  i) figure out how break this section down further.
    a) all content has an owner and a parent. 
    b) some of the math will probably be overly intensive early on, don't wory about the scaling of the math routines.
  ii) any specific info that can be posted.

    qr code
    ...

4) Products -- A product is a concept that can be purchased from a business by a consumer.
  i) description, tags, 
  ii) methods: getAverageValue(by location?)

5) Businesses -- An entity who is offering a sale. This entity has some legal liability. 
  i) businesses - how/what are their properties? (addresses, hours, tags, qualifications / liscenses?)

6) Offer - any business may offer any product for sale. If the product doesn't exist, it must be created first.

7) Purchases - when an offer is accepted, a transaction occurres and we must ensure payment and track it so we can report the status of the payment.

8) Search - list products, businesses, and offers by location, time, price and other criterion.

9) Subscriptions -> subscription code makes it so we can easily look up any and all subscriptions when any content node is updated and trigger some sort of subscription action.

10) Analytics - we need to track everything that users are doing.
  i) users - how many, what
  ii) business reporting
