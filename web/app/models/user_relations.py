This class registers user relationships with all other types of data..

Anytime that any content is updated, logic can be executed or queued for execution to knotify anyone who is subscribed.


This might be stupid. However, allowing relations between users and relations in a recursive fashion, will allow for concepts like "I'm following my christmas list, my christmas list is following _____".
