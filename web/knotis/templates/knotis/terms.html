Your account is non-transferrable and may not be sold, combined or otherwise shared with any other person. If you violate any of these limitations we may terminate your account and, without limitation, you may forfeit any pending, current or future promotional account credits and any unredeemed vouchers in your account.

      <h3><a name="terms-of-sale">6. Terms of Sale</a></h3>

      <p> Vouchers that you purchase through our Site as a Knotis account holder are special promotional offers that you purchase from participating Merchants through our service. The vouchers are redeemable for certain goods, services or experiences offered by, or facilitated through, the Merchant identified on the voucher. The Merchant is solely responsible for redeeming the voucher. The Merchant is the issuer of the voucher and is fully responsible for all goods and services it provides to you and for any and all injuries, illnesses, damages, claims, liabilities and costs (“<strong>Liabilities</strong>”) it may cause you to suffer, directly or indirectly, in full or in part, whether related to the use or redemption of a voucher or not. You waive and release Knotis and its subsidiaries, affiliates, partners, officers, directors, employees and agents from any Liabilities arising from or related to any act or omission of a Merchant in connection with your use of a voucher or the goods or services it provides in connection with the voucher.</p>

      <p>Descriptions of the products or services advertised on the Site are provided by the Merchant or other referenced third-parties. Knotis is not responsible for any performance or quality claims associated with product or service descriptions.</p>

      <p>Merchants may advertise services on the Site that may require an up-to-date regulatory authorization, license, or certification. Knotis does not verify, validate, or collect evidence of any regulatory authorization, license or certification from any Merchant (including Health & Fitness and Beauty & Spa Merchants). You should make whatever investigation or other resources that you deem necessary or appropriate before purchasing any Merchant’s promotional offers to determine if a Merchant is qualified to perform the advertised service. Merchant is solely responsible for the care and quality of goods and services being provided.</p>

      <p>Knotis is not a health or wellness provider and does not, will not and cannot refer, recommend or endorse any specific professional, services, products, or procedures to You that are advertised on the Site. The Site is not intended to be a substitute for professional advice, including medical and health advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always seek t
        
      <p>If an offer becomes unavailable between ordering and processing, Knotis will either cancel or not process the order and will notify you by email.</p>

      <p>Knotis does not guarantee that it offers best available rates or prices and does not guarantee against pricing errors. Knotis reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to not process or to cancel any orders placed for a product or service whose price was incorrectly posted on the Site as a result of an error. If this occurs, Knotis will notify you by email. In addition, Knotis reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to correct any error in the stated full retail price.</p>

      <p>Knotis is a service provider for the Merchant identified on the voucher and the Merchant is the sole issuer of the voucher. Vouchers have two separate values: (a) the “<strong>amount paid</strong>” and (b) the promotional value. The “<strong>promotional value</strong>” is the additional value beyond the amount paid. For example, if you pay $20 for a voucher that entitles you to $50 of goods or services from a Merchant, the amount paid is $20 (this amount does not expire until it is used or is refunded), and the promotional value is $30 (this amount expires on the date stated on the voucher unless expiration of the promotional value is prohibited by law). The Merchant is responsible for permitting you to redeem the voucher for at least the amount paid, even after the promotional value has expired.</p>

      <p>If a Merchant or venue refuses to honor any voucher, Knotis will refund the amount paid upon request, or will credit the Knotis account of the purchaser with an equivalent number of Knotis “Points” for future purchases on the Site. Need a refund or have a question? Email us at support@knotis.com. Vouchers are not redeemable for cash, unless required by law. Unauthorized or unlawful reproduction, resale, modification or trade of vouchers is prohibited. All descriptions, content, Products, and prices of Products and services on the Site may change at any time in Knotis’s discretion, without notice.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><u>Additional terms applicable to traditional Knotis vouchers.</u> A “<strong>traditional Knotis voucher</strong>” is any promotional voucher other than a ticket or a voucher redeemable for ticketed events. The promotional value of a traditional Knotis voucher will EXPIRE on the date specified on the face of the voucher, unless prohibited by law. The amount paid WILL NEVER EXPIRE. The promotional value of a traditional Knotis voucher may not be combined with other offers and no portion of its value is intended to cover tax or gratuity. Traditional Knotis vouchers are not reloadable, meaning that the amount paid of the voucher cannot be increased, and are fully transferrable.</li>
        <li>Certain Knotis offers, designated as “Now Offers” can only be redeemed for the full value between the hours specified on the Site and voucher. The promotional value of these vouchers will EXPIRE on the date and time specified on the voucher. The voucher may still be redeemed for the amount paid outside the specified dates and times. The promotional value of this type of voucher may not be combined with other offers and no portion of its value is intended to cover tax or gratuity. These types of vouchers are not reloadable and are fully transferrable.</li>
        <li><u>Special terms for tickets or Knotis vouchers redeemable for tickets to live events.</u></li>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 0">
          <li><i>Tickets and Vouchers.</i> Some vouchers are Knotis-brand tickets or Knotis vouchers redeemable for a ticket for admission to a specific ticketed event at a named venue. Tickets and vouchers have no value once the event date and time has passed. Tickets and vouchers are refundable to the purchaser in the original form of payment ONLY: (i) upon request until midnight on the day of purchase, (ii) automatically if the event is canceled and not rescheduled, and (iii) upon request if the event is rescheduled. Tickets and vouchers are sold inclusive of all taxes and additional fees unless otherwise noted and may not be combined with other offers. Tickets and vouchers do not include any applicable gratuity. Unless a specific exception is made, Tickets and vouchers are not eligible for upgrades and are not transferable. Certain resale premiums and restrictions may apply. A Ticket or voucher obtained from unauthorized sources may be lost, stolen or counterfeit, and if so is void.</li>
          <li><i>Venues and Events.</i> Opening acts, as well as individual performers, are subject to change or cancellation at any time without notice or recourse by you. Venues may search you as a condition of admission, ban or restrict certain items from being brought to the event and impose other rules on ticket-holders. You agree to all such rules and conditions and waive any related claims that may arise in conjunction with their imposition or execution. A ticket is a revocable license and admission may be refused for violation of the venue’s rules without refund, or for any or no reason upon refunding the amount paid. You voluntarily assume all risks and danger incidental to the event for which the Ticket or voucher is issued, whether occurring before, during or after the event, and you waive any claims for personal injury or death against Knotis, the venue, the issuer of the tickets and all of their respective affiliates, agents, officers, directors, owners and employees on behalf of yourself and any accompanying minor. You agree not to record or transmit, or aid in recording or transmitting, any description, account, picture, or reproduction of any event for which you purchase a Ticket or voucher. You agree that the event for which you purchase a Ticket or voucher is a public event, that your appearance and actions inside and outside the venue where the event occurs are public in nature, and that you have no expectation of privacy with regard to your actions or conduct at the event.</li></ul>
        <li><u>Additional terms for Knotis Local Products ("Local Pick-up" and "Local Shipping").</u> For some deals, Knotis will provide you with two options for receipt of your goods: Local Pick-up and Local Shipping. Options may vary based on a specific deal. The local merchant selling these goods retains all legal title for the goods sold. All deals are subject to the local merchant’s related terms and conditions, including the applicable return policy. Taxes and fees are included in the purchase price.
          <ul>
            <li><em>Local Pick-up.</em> When you opt to purchase a voucher with Local Pick-up you agree to pick-up the good at the local store listed on the voucher and deal page. Information about store hours, locations, and contact information is available on the voucher. A voucher for Local Pick-up is different than a traditional Knotis voucher, a ticket, or a voucher redeemable for a ticketed event, in each case, a voucher that is redeemable for a specific Good or Service. Local Pick-up vouchers are redeemable at the physical store location for in store pick-up as identified on the Local Pick-up voucher and expire on a date certain when the goods are no longer available for pick-up. Knotis will automatically refund you if you are unable to redeem your voucher before the expiration date.</li>
            <li><em>Local Shipping.</em> When you purchase a deal with Local Shipping you agree to receive goods by shipment to the address you provide. Following your purchase, no further action is required. The local merchant selling the goods will ship the goods directly to you.</li>

If those efforts fail, by using this Site you agree that any claim, dispute, or controversy you may have against Knotis arising out of, relating to, or connected in any way with this Agreement this Site or the purchase or sale of any voucher(s), shall be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and conducted before a single arbitrator pursuant to the applicable Rules and Procedures established by AAA (“Rules and Procedures”).
